.. note::

    The CCBlade installation also installs the module :ref:`AirfoilPrep.py <airfoilprep:airfoilpreppy-label>`.  Although it is not necessary to use AirfoilPrep.py with CCBlade, its inclusion is convenient when working with AeroDyn input files or doing any aerodynamic preprocessing of airfoil data.
